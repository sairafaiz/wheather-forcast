# weather-app

What the project does:

This a Vanilla Javascript weather app will pull the current weather condition as well as a 6-day forecast for a location. Location can be manually searched by typing in a city (no state or country) and pressing search. Or, use the user can click the locator button to automatically detect the nearest city.

Cities are based on what is available through the OpenWeather API and cities across the globe are accessible. This was built in the USA, so imperial units are default. User may switch to imperial by clicking the appropriate units link (located in the current conditions section).

This project is useful becuase it allows you to get the weather anywhere in the world.
